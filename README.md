My first visual novel project created with Ren'Py engine

Library of Sins
Library of Sins is an ambitious visual novel project developed using the Ren'Py engine. It combines multiple genres and explores profound psychological themes through a multi-dimensional narrative.

1. Concept and Vision
The game is a multi-genre experience where the player traverses various worlds, each featuring a unique setting, plot, and atmosphere. While the worlds differ in genre, they are subtly interconnected through a central mystery.

Goal: To provide an engaging gameplay experience while shedding light on complex life issues and heavy philosophical themes.

Structure: The game features 5 planned worlds, each serving as a separate chapter with its own unique challenges.

2. Storyline and Character Arc
The narrative follows a female protagonist named Anna, who serves as a vessel to explain life's hardships to the player.

The Beginning: Anna wakes up in a mysterious, vast Library with no memory of how she arrived or who she is. This Library serves as the "Hub" — the central point for entering and exiting different worlds.

The Quest: Anna’s primary motivation is to uncover her past. As she completes each world, fragments of her "history" begin to surface.

The Twist (Meta-Narrative): Ultimately, Anna discovers that she has no past. She was created instantaneously by "The Author" specifically to be a character for the player.

The Lore: Before Anna, The Author attempted to create other protagonists without pasts, but they lacked the necessary "Player Strength" to survive the story. Anna is the first to succeed.

The Origin: The very first protagonist created by The Author had a rich backstory, but their journey ended in a devastating tragedy. This led The Author to decide that future characters must be created without a past to avoid such pain. (This backstory is planned to be explored in a spin-off: Library of Sins: Backstory).

3. World Building
The Great Library: The central gateway between realities. Beyond being a hub, it holds hidden secrets about the nature of existence and the Author's previous "failures."

The 5 Worlds: Diverse dimensions ranging from horror and drama to mystery, all designed to test Anna's resolve and the player's choices.

Technical Note
This repository contains the core logic and scripts for the game.

Language: The current dialogue scripts are in Russian.

Engine: Built with Ren'Py (Python-based).
